In 2021, the Hobby School of Public Affairs at the University of Houston and the Texas Southern University launched a five-year survey project to study Texas’s changing population. The survey includes a representative sample of Texas with an over sample of the state’s Black, Latino, and Asian residents, which were the three groups of interest for the study. The results of the 2022 survey will be presented in [five separate reports](http://m2s-conf.uh.edu/hobby/txtrends/): the 2022 general election in Texas, gun safety, the economy, criminal justice, and healthcare.
