## About me

I am a PhD student in Economics at [Universtity of Houston](https://www.uh.edu/class/economics/). Formerly, I studied my BA at National Autonomous University of Mexico [(UNAM)](http://www.economia.unam.mx/), and MSc at Mexico Autonomous Institute of Technology [(ITAM)](https://posgrados.itam.mx/).

Previously, I worked as an economist at the Federal Economic Competition Commission [(COFECE)](https://www.cofece.mx/?lang=en), and the Mexican Social Security Institute [(IMSS)](http://www.imss.gob.mx/), both in Mexico City.

My research lies in the intersection between empirical industrial organization, health economics, and development.
